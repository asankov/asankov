### Hi, folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anton Sankov!

I am a passionate software developer, currently working at VMware Carbon Black.

I am also a Core Team member of [Kiwi TCMS](https://github.com/kiwitcms) - the leading Open Source Test Case Management System.

In my free time I like reading books, playing video games and... programming.

You can check out some of my hobby projects:
